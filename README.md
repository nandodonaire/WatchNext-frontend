WatchNext frontend

WatchNext is a full-stack web application that allows users to create a queue
or list of TV shows and Movies that they are interested in watching. Rather than
having queues on multiple streaming services (e.g Netflix, Hulu, etc), WatchNext
allows users to store all of the shows and movies thay are interested in watching
and add where they can watch them.

I got this idea because I find myself having trouble keeping track of what I'd
like to watch and where I can watch it. Since there are so many streaming services,
it's getting harder and harder to keep track of what is available where.

This is the client-facing frontend, which interacts with the custom backend that
I built (https://github.com/nandodonaire/WatchNext-backend). The frontend of the
application was built using JavaScript, JQuery, Ajax, HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, and
Handlebars.

Through the frontend, users are able to sign up (create an account), login,
add to the queue, fetch data from the queue, update the items on the queue, and
delete items from the queue.

User Stories:

1) As a user, I'd like to create an account and have shows/movies associated
with my account.

2) As a user, I'd like to enter the shows (and/or movies) I'm interested in
watching in a database.

3) As a user, I'd like to be able to see a list of these shows/movies with
titles, where I can watch them, and genre.

4) As a user, I'd like the option to only see a single entry from the database.

5) As a user, I'd like to be able to remove the shows/movies that I've seen from
the database.

Future enhancements:

1) In a future release, I'd like to add more styling and make it more responsive
on larger/smaller screen sizes.
